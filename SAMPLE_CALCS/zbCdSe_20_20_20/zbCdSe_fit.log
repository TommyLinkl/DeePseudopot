Reading and setting up the bulkSystems. 
There are 2 atomic pseudopotentials. They are in the order of: 
['Cd' 'Se']
Cd is being initialized to the function form as stored in inputs/init_CdParams.par
Se is being initialized to the function form as stored in inputs/init_SeParams.par
tensor([[-31.4518,   1.3890,  -0.0502,   1.6603,   0.0586],
        [  8.4921,   4.3513,   1.3600,   0.3227,   0.1746]])

Initializing the NN by fitting to the latest function form of pseudopotentials. 
Epoch [500/1000], Validation Loss: 0.0338
Epoch [1000/1000], Validation Loss: 0.0203
GPU initialization: elapsed time: 41.98 seconds

Done with NN initialization to the latest function form.

Plotting and write pseudopotentials in the real and reciprocal space.

Evaluating band structures using the initialized pseudopotentials. 
After fitting the NN to the latest function forms, we can reproduce satisfactory band structures. 
The total bandStruct MSE = 2.726032e+01
