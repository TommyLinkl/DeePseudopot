Reading and setting up the bulkSystems. 
There are 4 atomic pseudopotentials. They are in the order of: 
['As' 'Ga' 'In' 'P']
As is being initialized to the function form as stored in inputs/init_AsParams.par
Ga is being initialized to the function form as stored in inputs/init_GaParams.par
In is being initialized to the function form as stored in inputs/init_InParams.par
P is being initialized to the function form as stored in inputs/init_PParams.par

Initializing the NN with file inputs/init_PPmodel.pth.

Done with NN initialization to the file inputs/init_PPmodel.pth.

Plotting and write pseudopotentials in the real and reciprocal space.

Evaluating band structures using the initialized pseudopotentials. 
After fitting the NN to the latest function forms, we can reproduce satisfactory band structures. 
The total bandStruct MSE = 2.582289e+02
