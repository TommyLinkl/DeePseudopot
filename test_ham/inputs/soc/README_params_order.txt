the order of the input params is:

ppParams[0]-ppParams[3] = local Zunger potential, as before
ppParams[4] = long-range constant (only defined for N-1 atom types, since there is a constraint)
ppParams[5] = SOC constant
ppParams[6]-ppParams[7] = nonlocal constants
ppParams[8] = strain tensor constant
