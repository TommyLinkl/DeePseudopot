# NN_pseudopotential_fitting
Parametrize semi-empirical pseudopotentials through deep neural networks for low-cost, high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations

## Code details
- zbCdSe_fitting_numpy.ipynb: Calculates the zinc-blende CdSe band structure from the Zunger pseudopotential form via numpy

- zbCdSe_fitting_NN_init.ipynb: Uses a neural network to fit the band structure of zinc-blende CdSe. Adapts the numpy methods to PyTorch tensor library.
